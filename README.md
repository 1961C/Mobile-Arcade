### Concept

> "To develop a mobile arcade cabinet that can be controlled over Bluetooth to enable ultimate portability and usability, while maintaining retro charm."

The Mobile Arcade was designed to incorporate a retro gaming experience with quarkey mobile chassis. The original idea was centered around a table top arcade experience with additional entertainment features, including vibrent and responsive lighting. In order to better suit and entertain the target audiance (children aged 9 through 14), mobility was incorporated as well. With this in mind, the following design requirements were set:

1 Fully functional, single player, arcade system
* Ability to play NES and Atari games
2 Visually pleasing enclosure with a retro feel
3 Interactive lighting
4 Basic Bluetooth-controlled mobility
