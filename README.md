### Concept

> "To develop a mobile arcade cabinet that can be controlled over Bluetooth to enable ultimate portability and usability, while maintaining retro charm."

The Mobile Arcade was designed to incorporate a retro gaming experience with quirky mobile chassis. The original idea was centered around a table top arcade experience with additional entertainment features, including vibrant and responsive lighting. In order to better suit and entertain the target audience (children aged 9 through 14), mobility was incorporated as well. With this in mind, the following design requirements were set:
1. Fully functional, single player, arcade system (ability to play NES and Atari games)
2. Visually pleasing enclosure with a retro feel
3. Interactive lighting
4. Basic Bluetooth-controlled mobility 

### System Design

The design of the mobile arcade was divided into distinct subsystems which were later interfaces. These subsystems included the physical enclosure, the arcade emulator, and the mobility driver. Each of these systems are outlined here.

The following block diagram illustrates all components of the arcade system:

* Raspberry Pi: Main processor & arcade game emulator, user interface
* GPIO Interfaces: Joystick, buttons controller
* mBED: Microcontroller in charge of lights, remote control and drive system
* Bluetooth Bridge: Communication between remote control phone and the mBED
* Dual-Channel Motor Driver: Motor driver for running the tank-drive motors
* LED Strips: Decorative lights, ran by the mBED
* Power: Li-Po battery and regulator for all components

### Physical Enclosure

The enclosure was designed using Dassault Systemsâ€™ Solid Works. Each portion of the seven component design was fitted together in software before fabrication was attempted. The structure was set as 3/32in clear acrylic sheets.

The overall shape of the enclosure resembles that of a standard arcade cabinet, however there are a few notable exceptions. The design is much simpler than standard cabinets, reducing the number of distinct components that need to be fabricated for the system to fit together. Additionally, the cabinet incorporates mounting holes specifically designed to accommodate drive motors. Two motors can be fixed near the front of the cabinet, while a rounded skid drags at the rear. This produces a "tank drive" configuration which allows the enclosure to maneuver around its environment.

### Arcade Emulator

### mBED Breakout & Drive System

In order to connect the mBED, Bluetooth Bridge, and Dual-Channel motor driver together, a single-layer breakout board was created and fabricated. Side-plugs were soldered to allow the motors and LEDs, as well as an auxiliary power source.

The following library was used to control the Dual-Channel motor driver:

[All code for the mBED can be found here.](https://os.mbed.com/users/abraha2d/code/MobileArcade/file/)

Wheels were added to both sides of the motors to improve stability and ensure traction. Since the rear contact point is a slider, more traction is required for turns. Below is an image with the left two wheels in place.

### LEDs

[Dotstar LEDs](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2239?length=1) were used to decorate the Arcade, and were chosen due to the relaxed timing requirements, allowing relatively  easy interface with the mBED. A simple library was used and is linked below:

[Custom Dotstar mBED library.](https://os.mbed.com/users/abraha2d/code/APA102/)

Code was written to accept input from the Raspberry Pi to synchronize lighting effects to certain events in the Emulator. For example, on emulation startup, a startup animation is shown on the LEDs. Other effects were added for when games are started and stopped. The Raspberry Pi sends serial commands via USB to the mBED.

### Power System

The arcade is powered from a large lithium-ion battery pack. A 5V, 3A regulator is used to provide power for the Raspberry Pi, mBED system, and the motors. The LCD contains an internal regulator, and is able to plug directly into the battery without further regulation.

The image below contains the battery and regulator plugged into the mBED breakout board.
